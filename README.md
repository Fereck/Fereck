- ðŸ‘‹ My name is Fereck, Iâ€™m 20 years old, and Iâ€™ve always been passionate about technology. From a young age, curiosity has driven me to explore and learn. Iâ€™m constantly growing and developing my skills, and right now, Iâ€™m focused on studying hacking.

I have hands-on experience with tools like Nmap, Wireshark, and Metasploit, along with proficiency in Python for automating tasks and developing custom scripts. One of my recent projects involves building a graphical interface to enhance the usability of network scanning tools.

Iâ€™m currently working towards my Pentester+ certification to further deepen my knowledge in penetration testing. My long-term goal is to become a professional pentester.

Iâ€™m a strong problem solver and thrive in dynamic environments, always staying up to date with the latest technologies entering the market.
